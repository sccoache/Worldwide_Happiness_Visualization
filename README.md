Background and Motivation
---
The motivation for choosing this project was to determine what factors make people happy.  We saw a dataset of how happy people ranked themselves and decided we wanted to try to correlate that data to other economic factors, like proximity to parks, historical events, family size and other data points.  

>>Discuss your motivations and reasons for choosing this project, especially any background or research interests that may have influenced your decision.

Project Objectives 
---
Some questions we are trying to answer ourselves and through our data visualizations are as follows.

- What makes people happy? 
- How does happiness compare across the world?
- What differences between countries cause certain countries to be happier?
- How do self perception (pessimism, view of others) affect accuracy of how happy people think they are?

We chose this data because we want to learn about the world and how happy people 

>>Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer with your visualization. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits.

Data
---


>>From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources.

Data Processing
---


>>Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data processing be implemented?

Visualization Design
---


>>How will you display your data? Provide some general ideas that you have for the visualization design. Develop three alternative prototype designs for your visualization. Create one final design that incorporates the best of your three designs. Describe your designs and justify your choices of visual encodings. We recommend you use the Five Design Sheet Methodology.

Features
---
### Must-Have Features


>>List the features without which you would consider your project to be a failure.

### Optional Features


>>List the features which you consider to be nice to have, but not critical.

Project Schedule
---


>>Make sure that you plan your work so that you can avoid a big rush right before the final project deadline, and delegate different modules and responsibilities among your team members. Write this in terms of weekly deadlines.
Each team member must push this document into his/her homework directory. As a ballpark number: your proposal should contain about 3-4 pages of text, plus 5-6 pages of sketches.
